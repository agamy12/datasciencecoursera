I study at Fayoum University whose fees $25 as I can not afford joining world top universities due to their high fees although I would like to be taught there

I am  a computer science student and I have dedicated my life to learn to learn computer engineering and I would like to improve this track of knowledge through taking this course and I believe in MOOC movement that it will change the world especially the developing countries like Egypt

I will tryas hard as I can to learn this course and teach it to my other colleagues to transfer knowledge as I have taken them from here
